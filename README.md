# Wunix

## Stable Public Release — v1.0.0

Wunix is a developer terminal command pack designed to improve productivity (and maybe some fun commands too).
### Philosophy

Wunix focuses on developer utility commands combined with lightweight entertainment commands (mostly linux inspired).

The project is open source and welcomes community contributions.

Note: Wunix is not a terminal replacement.
